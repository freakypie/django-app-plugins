==================
django-app-plugins
==================

Many reusable django applications are intended to plug-into another set of
applictions in a sites template framework. The connonical example of this is
a preferences widget for the application which should be included with other
preferences on a sites user preferences page. At the same time the author of
the reusable applicaiton does not want to tightly couple their app to some
specific larger framework, or require other people to use some third party
package just to use their app.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality. This
includes:

 * Reusable applicaitons need not require app_plugins for use.
 * Provide 'plugin points' in templates for where to insert multiple plugins
 * Optional administrative site-level control over the visiability, order, and control of plugins
 * Optional user level control over the visibility and order of plugins (e.g. public profile page)
